# Hillary's Chat Application
This is a school assignment for Fanshawe College's multimedia authoring class. We had to create an interactive chat application using Node, socket.io and Heroku. This chat app is currently running live.

**Chat App Skin:** My chat app is specifically set to dark mode.

**Functionality:** The first functionality I added is a message which pops up indiciating a new user joined the chat app. Second, I added how how many users are online in the chat app at one time. Lastly, I used different colours to differentiate users and their messages - these being grey and blue.

**Additional Enhancement:** The one other enhancement I added was a timestamp indicating when a user sent their message - this is shown below the users message when they send one.

## Built With
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment used to build scalable applications
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) - JavaScript package manager
* [socket.io](https://socket.io/) - JavaScript library for realtime web applications
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS compiler
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Cloud application platform
