# Hillary's Chat Application
This is a school assignment for authoring class. We have to create an interactive chat application using Node, socket.io and Heroku.

Chat App Skin: Dark Mode.

Functionality: The first functionality added was adding a message when a new user joins the chat app. Second, I added how how many users are online in the chat app at one time. Lastly, I used different colours to differentiate users and their messages.

Additional Enhancement: The one other enhancement I added was a timestamp indicating when a user sent their message - this is shown below the users message.

## Built With
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment used to build scalable applications
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) - JavaScript development tool
* [socket.io](https://socket.io/) - JavaScript library for realtime web applications
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS compiler
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Cloud application platform
